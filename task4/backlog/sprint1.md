### User Story 1: Start a Personalized Game

- **As a** player  
- **I want to** provide my name at the beginning of the game  
- **So that** the game experience feels personalized and engaging  

#### Acceptance Criteria:
1. At the start of the game, I am greeted with a welcome message and asked for my name (e.g., “Welcome to the greatest quiz show in existence! What’s your name, superstar?”).
2. After providing my name, the system remembers it and uses it in all future interactions (e.g., “Let’s see what [name] can do!”).  
3. When choosing to play again, my name is remembered, and I am not asked to re-enter it.

### User Story 2: Answer a Multiple-Choice Question  

- **As a** player  
- **I want to** see a multiple-choice question with four clear answer options (A-D)  
- **So that** I can pick an answer and progress in the game  

#### Acceptance Criteria:
1. Each quiz question includes a clearly visible question and four options, labeled A–D (e.g., "A. Option 1, B. Option 2, etc.").  
2. The game waits for my input (A, B, C, or D) and processes my choice only after I provide it.  
3. The system confirms the correctness of my answer with short, witty commentary (e.g., “That’s correct, [name]! You’re on fire!” or “Oh no, [name], that’s not quite right!”).

### User Story 3: Replay After Losing the Game  

- **As a** player  
- **I want to** replay the game after losing without re-entering information  
- **So that** I can try again for a better outcome while maintaining continuity  

#### Acceptance Criteria:
1. After losing, I am told how much money I’ve won (or nothing, if I failed the first question).  
2. I am prompted with the question, “Would you like to play again? (yes/no)”.  
3. If I select “yes,” the game resets to question 1 while using the same player name I provided earlier. If I select “no,” the game ends with a humorous or dramatic message (e.g., “Thanks for playing, [name], and remember: not all trivia leads to millions!”).
