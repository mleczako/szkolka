### User Story 1: Start the game and personalize the experience

- I want to provide my name at the start of the game,  
- So that I feel personally engaged and recognized throughout the game.  

**Acceptance Criteria:**  
- The game prompts the player to enter their name at the beginning of the session.  
- The entered name is displayed during interactions throughout the game (e.g., "Great job, [player name]!").

### User Story 2: Ask questions and accept answers  
- **As a player**,  
- I want to answer multiple-choice quiz questions,

**Acceptance Criteria:**  
- The game presents each question clearly with four options (A. B. C. D).  
- The player can submit their answer by choosing one option (e.g., "A" or "B").

### User Story 3: Handle incorrect answers gracefully  
- **As a player**,  
- I want to know when I answer a question incorrectly,  
- So that I can learn from my mistake and decide whether to play again or end the game.  

**Acceptance Criteria:**  
- If the answer is incorrect, the game informs the player in an engaging manner (e.g., "Oops, the correct answer was [correct answer].").  
- The game displays how much money the player has won based on the last correct question, following the prize ladder.  
- The game asks whether the player would like to play again ("yes/no") and acts accordingly:  
  - If "yes", the player starts a new session from Question 1 with their saved name.  
  - If "no", the game ends with a fun or dramatic closing line.
